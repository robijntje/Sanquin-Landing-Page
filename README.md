# Sanquin Web App
This is a web app created, designed and developed by Robin for the Sanquin project at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. This web application is designed to inform users about blood donation and encourage them to become donors. It provides stories about the importance of blood donation and answers to common questions. The app is specifically tailored to the needs of Generation Z and has been built with their needs and questions in mind by testing and engaging with them during creation, design and development. The language of the application is Dutch.
## Theme
The theme of the app is based on the 'Doneer bloed. Red levens.' ('Donate blood. Save lives.') advertising campaign created by Robin, with a focus on personal stories about the impact of blood donation.
## Pages
The webapp has several pages that tailor to different needs of the target audience.
### Landing page (Home)
The landing page, or home page, is the first page users see when they open the webapp. The page functions as a step between an advertising/user campaign and the information on the website. The campaign slogan ('Doneer bloed. Red levens.') is shown with some additional facts in the middle-bottom of the page. The facts shown are reasons a user should become a blood donor and are based on research on what the target audience thinks are the best/most important reasons for becoming a blood donor. The user can choose how to continue by pressing one of three buttons or using the side menu: sign-up as a donor, see more information, or watch personal stories.
### Information page (Meer informatie)
The information page is a page where a user gets a set of frequently asked questions. The questions are chosen based on the different questions the target audience asked while considering becoming a blood donor. The questions are answered on seperate pages to change the user experience based on the complexity of the answer.
### Story page (Bekijk de verhalen)
The story page is a page where users can watch a video about different patients who received blood transfusions. These are the stories of people who feature in the advertising campaign.
